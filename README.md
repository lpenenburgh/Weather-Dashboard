# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
My goal for this project was create a simple app the allows the user to look up the current weather as well as a 5 day forcast for a city of their choosing. 

## Usage
When the user enters a city in the search bar, 2 different API's get called from the "OpenWeather" app to get current and future weather data. From these API calls, the page displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, as well as weather icons. The weather icons and color of the UV Index changes depending on the current value recieved from the API's data.  Once the user looks up a new city, the data displayed on the screen updates, while their past searches are saved in local storage and then shown under the search bar.
