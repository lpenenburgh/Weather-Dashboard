# Weather-Dashboard

## User-Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Description
My goal for this project was create a simple app the allows the user to look up the current weather as well as a 5 day forcast for a city of their choosing. To be able to get current and future weather data, I used 2 different API calls from the "OpenWeather" app. From these API calls, I was able to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, as well as weather icons on my page. The weather icons and color of the UV Index changes depending on the current value recieved from the API's data.  Once the user looks up a new city, the data displayed on the screen updates, while their past searches are saved in local storage and then shown under the search bar. To get accurate/updating dates, I used moment.js.
